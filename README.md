# Bachelor's Project: MyBulletJournal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In today’s very busy world, it’s more important than ever to keep yourself organized in order to be able to keep track of all areas and aspects of your daily life. There are, of course, multiple ways to do this. The most common one is by writing to-do lists and keeping a personal planner. But for those of us who like to get creative, there is also a more fun option: bullet journaling.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bullet journaling is a combination between keeping a calendar, a to-do list and a habit tracker all wrapped in one, while also using your creativity to design meaningful and beautiful pages which are called spreads. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that idea in mind, I created a full stack web application meant specifically for creating bullet journal spreads that can then be printed and colored in. This way, we are shifting the focus from the repetitive process of sketching your spreads to the creative and fun part of it. You still get to be creative, keep track of everything and make the most of your time.

## Features:
### Left hand side menus:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a menu with 3 different types of objects from which to choose in order to create a new spread: shapes, text and lines. Each of these can then be manipulated and edited to the user's liking.
- Drag and drop, resize, rotate and remove shapes
- Drag and drop, resize, rotate, edit and remove text
- Add and undo lines of 4 thicknesses and colors


### Right hand side panel:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the panel on the right, we have some account related features. Saving a template and reloading it onto the working canvas is allowed only once you are logged in.
- Signup
- Login
- Save template
- Reload template (open a previous template to reuse or keep working on)

The rest of the settings and features are available to all users.
- Page size (A5 and B5)
- Page type (Blank or Dotted)
- Download template (with .svg extension)
- Clear handles (handles that manipulate objects)
- Clear paper


### Middle panel - template canvas:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The templates will be built on the canvas in the middle. All the objects you select from the menus on the left will appear on the canvas. You can then manipulate them in order to create your desired bullet journal spread. We also have a trash can icon that removes objects on hover.
